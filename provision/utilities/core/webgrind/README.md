## Summary

Webgrind is a [Xdebug](http://www.xdebug.org) profiling web frontend in PHP. It implements a subset of the features of [kcachegrind](http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html) and installs in seconds and works on all platforms. For quick'n'dirty optimizations it does the job. Here's a screenshot showing the output from profiling:

## Features

  * Super simple, cross platform installation - obviously :)
  * Track time spent in functions by self cost or inclusive cost. Inclusive cost is time inside function + calls to other functions.
  * See if time is spent in internal or user functions.
  * See where any function was called from and which functions it calls.
  * Generate a call graph using [gprof2dot.py](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot)
