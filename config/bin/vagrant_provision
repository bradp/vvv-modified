# This script is run after a provision. To customize this behavior,
# include a file in your local VVV/config/homebin
# directory: vagrant_provision_custom

# Note that sometimes provisioning happens on `vagrant up ──provision`
# so if you have a vagrant_up_custom file, be careful of double
# execution

# Look for a custom trigger file. If this exists, we'll assume that
# all trigger actions should be handled by this custom script. If
# it does not exist, then we'll handle some basic tasks.
